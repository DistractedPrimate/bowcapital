https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamelacapalad/,"A few years ago, I had a very long, difficult conversation with a friend that will go down as another sad story about someone else who was fleeced by a financial advisor.It reminded me why I do what I do.Financial literacy education isn’t about investing in the stock market, or starting a business, or budgeting, or credit cards. It’s not about making sure you’re with the right bank or having the best interest rate or making the right investment choices.It’s about empowering people who are normally made to feel vulnerable or weak or helpless, it’s about empowering you to take control and recognize that you have the knowledge and confidence to find true freedom and happiness. It’s about educating you enough to know who to trust not just with your money, but with your livelihoods.I’ve devoted my life to financial literacy. I devoted my life to it because I don’t expect you to do the same. I devoted my life to financial literacy to help you get to THAT place in your life. You know that place. That place where you close your eyes and feel perfectly at peace and energized all at the same time. That place where you know you’re at your best, that you were somehow built for this, this thing you’re doing that you can’t believe you get to spend your life doing.Life isn’t about cringing every time you run your credit card through a cash register or dodging calls from bill collectors. It’s not about the next paycheck, next rent check, next job, next in line.Life is about finding your why.So here’s the deal – You tell me your why, I’ll tell you your how.How do you find the bank that won’t charge you $12 a month for keeping your money? How do you start to pay off your student loans? How do you start saving up for your dream apartment? How do you plan for the next six months of inconsistent income? How do you set your life up so you travel 3 months out of the year?Helping you find the answers to these very big questions - this is MY why.",Greater New York City Area,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQHEw5IFTehw3A/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0?e=1586995200&v=beta&t=wlsFVnFUUecAWfaaPNmXTjIwIY4Brj01443AGsAvb1I,Pamela,"Capalad, CFP®, AFC®","Pamela Capalad, CFP®, AFC®",1303,ACoAAADPpBEBhfk0RS25cTRyQyRO2xL5xudAxbc,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAADPpBEBhfk0RS25cTRyQyRO2xL5xudAxbc,name",Brunch & Budget,https://www.linkedin.com/company/brunch-&-budget/,Founder & Financial Planner,Jan 2015 – Present,Brunch & Budget,https://www.linkedin.com/company/brunch-&-budget/,Podcast Host,Jun 2014 – Present,UC Santa Barbara,https://www.linkedin.com/school/17959/?legacySchoolId=17959,2003 – 2007,,,brunchandbudget.com,https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamelacapalad,pamelacapalad,2020-02-09T03:21:21.686Z,,"I wanted to find a way to help the average person with their finances.

Each pint packs fresh avocado, making Cado a nutrient-dense dessert that tastes divine and leaves you feeling satisfied and nourished.

We can see your form, we can see your shots, and we can now see your progress. With just a smartphone, anyone, anywhere, can be guided by a professional trainer. These workouts can adapt on the fly, have games built into them, and adjust based on your particular needs or goals. What's doubly important is that they're enjoyable--from the kid who needs to get off the couch a bit more all the way up to players in the NBA. We gamify goals and simplify training so the only thing you need to do is hit ""Start."" Compete with friends, join teams, achieve your goals, have fun.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-james-00aa6412/,"My extensive formal training and career experience provide a solid foundation for leading product, market, and business development efforts in technologically complex markets—in particular, those requiring product solutions based on disparate technologies and in environments where industry dynamics and professional politics are as important as product performance (e.g., medical technology).  I have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to ascertain fundamental market needs, to evaluate technological approaches, and to guide product and business development efforts accordingly—i.e.,  Match the technologically possible to the economically important.  I have extensive experience in several market areas and technological disciplines. This includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its medical applications (three FDA 510Ks), MRI market dynamics towards development and marketing of an in-office MRI scanner, development of cryogenic low noise antennas for MRI, and the physics and signal processing required for microscopic biologic tissue texture diagnostic assessment, using magnetic resonance-based techniques. Further, I led the effort to develop a digital x-ray imager, based on underlying thin film transistor technology.  My early career focused on Materials Science technology development across a range of magnetic, mechanical, and electronic materials systems (often at cryogenic temperatures). Over the past 20+ years I have focused on applying technology to new market opportunities.  These efforts have covered a wide range of technologies and applications culminating in the invention and development of magnetic resonance-based techniques for in vivo characterization of anatomical structures in the feature size range of a few 10s to a few 100s of microns.  This is an entirely new and enabling capability in medicine and the origin of bioProtonics, Inc., of which I am a founder and Director.","Santa Barbara, California",https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQE4UcT23kKx6w/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0?e=1586995200&v=beta&t=zuBm26eNTHf_ZysUUAgAIqNsi4CfU_G0N1WXfqCxbtU,Tim,James,Tim James,,ACoAAAKl2QoBBkWvjeqrSt6n07JCaV3Q-9k-uOs,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAKl2QoBBkWvjeqrSt6n07JCaV3Q-9k-uOs,name",bioProtonics,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=bioProtonics%20,CEO and Founder,Jan 2018 – Present,CBRITE Inc,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cbrite-inc/,Vice President,Jul 2014 – Apr 2018,UC Santa Barbara,https://www.linkedin.com/school/17959/?legacySchoolId=17959,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-james-00aa6412,tim-james-00aa6412,2020-02-09T03:41:09.270Z,3rd+,,VP Business Development,,PhD,"R&D, Start-ups, Product Development, Product Management, Entrepreneurship, Image Processing, Algorithms",R&D,3,Start-ups,2,Product Development,1,Product Management,1,Entrepreneurship,1,Image Processing,0,"Santa Barbara, California Area",Materials Science,,,,,,,,,,

While I am considered an expert in multiple disciplines, I feel I still have a lot to learn and enjoy continuously furthering my skills and solving problems in new fields. My most unique skill is arguably creativity, which has led me to become a prolific inventor with over one hundred issued patents to my name. I was fortunate to start my career at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL-NASA), where I spent nearly ten years contributing to developments in optical interferometry for detection of planets around other stars, and leading R&D on novel miniature inertial sensors using micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technology. At JPL, I had the privilege of learning from many outstanding scientists and engineers. In 2000, I started the new century by taking a leap and leaving JPL to start my first commercial venture with a colleague named Dr. Tony Tang. Over the last 18 years, I have continued to partner with Dr. Tang in creating six additional new startup companies, and we look forward to jointly creating many new commercial ventures in the future. These new ventures have given me the opportunity to continue to learn about exciting new technologies and applications and engaging in exciting R&D in new fields.

I achieved a significant milestone with the first experimental demonstration of a 2D transistor to beat the fundamental limitation in turn-on characteristics of state-of-the-art devices, thus, cracking the long-standing issue of simultaneous dimensional and power supply scalability. My work also, showed for the first time, that such transistors, can revolutionize a completely diverse field of bio/gas-sensor technology by providing ultra-high sensitivity, and an attractive pathway for single molecular detectability- the holy grail for all biosensing research. My present research focuses on understanding the brain which when decoded, can not only open up new avenues for treatment of neuronal disorders but can also transform the way electronic computations are performed today.
